Follow these steps carefully:
1) type npm install  in terminal to install all the required dependencies
2) Create an .env file and just add the required value of variables in it
   .env file includes following variables:
    APP_PORT (like 3000), 
    COOKIES_SECRET (like NUSTISLAMABAD), 
    DB_URL (mongo db atlasurl), 
    STRIPE_KEY (login to stripe and get a private key in developers mode)
    APP_URL, 
    JWT_SECRET, 
    USER(gmail account), 
    PASSWORD(gmail password)
3) type npm run dev to start your app
Now your app is ready to run.
